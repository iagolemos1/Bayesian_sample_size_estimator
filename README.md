# Bayesian Sample Size Estimator

This repository presents the implementation of the Bayesian approach for computing a posteriori sample size for a given sample. 
It implementates the algorithm presented by [Khalifa et al, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2011.08.001).

The file [final_usar.py](https://github.com/iagolemos1/Bayesian_sample_size_estimator/blob/master/final_usar.py) is a interfaced with Tkinter program for
computing the sample size, while the [Bayesian_Sample_Size_Estimator.py](https://github.com/iagolemos1/Bayesian_sample_size_estimator/blob/master/Bayesian_Sample_Size_Estimator.py)
is the algorithm itself.
